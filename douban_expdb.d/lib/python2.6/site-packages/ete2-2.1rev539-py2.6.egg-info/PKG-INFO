Description: The Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE) is a Python programming
        toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and
        visualization of phylogenetic trees (although clustering trees or any
        other tree-like data would, in principle, supported).  ETE is built as
        a Python library, thus providing the methods to operate with trees
        within your own python programs.
        
        ETE is developed as a tool for researchers working in phylogenetics
        and genomics. If you use ETE in a published work, please cite:

        DESCRIPTION
        ****************
        
        Supported Tree Formats:
        ========================
        
        Currently, the following tree data formats are supported, both for
        reading and writing trees:
        
         - Newick (including several sub-types)
         - Extended Newick / New Hampshire Extended (NHX) 
         - PhyloXML
         - NeXML
        
        Tree operations: 
        ================
        
        With ETE, trees are loaded as a succession of TreeNode objects
        connected in a hierarchical way. Each TreeNode instance contains
        methods to operate with it independently. This is, although the
        top-most TreeNode instance represents the whole tree structure, any
        child node can be used independently as a subtree instance.
        
        Available (per node) operations include:
        
         - Iteration over descendant or leaf nodes.
         - Tree traversing: post-order, pre-order, level-order-
         - Search (descendant) nodes by their properties.
         - Root / Unroot
         - Calculate branch-length and topological distances among nodes.
         - Node annotation (add custom features and properties to nodes)
         - Automatic tree pruning 
         - Tree structure manipulation (add/remove parent, children, sister
           nodes, etc.).
         - Newick and extended newick (including annotations) conversion
         - shortcuts and checks: "len(Node)", "for leaf in Node", "if node in
           Tree", etc. 
        
        
        Tree Visualization:
        ===================
        
        A programmatic tree rendering engine is fully integrated with the Tree
        objects. It allows to draw trees in both rectangular and circular
        modes. The aspect of nodes, branches and other tree items are fully
        configurable and can be dynamically controlled (this is, certain
        graphical properties of nodes can be linked to internal node values).
        
        Trees can be visualized interactively using a built-in Graphical User
        Interface (GUI) or exported as PNG images or SVG/PDF vector graphics
        images.
        
        
        Phylogenetic Trees: 
        ===================
        
        ETE is not a phylogenetic reconstruction program, as it only provides
        methods to load, analyze and manipulate phylogenetic results. Thus, a
        PhyloTree instance is provided, which extends the standard Tree
        functionality with phylogenetics related methods. Most notably:
        
        - Link trees with Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs).
        - Automatic detection of species codes within family gene-trees
        - Node monophyly checks.
        - Orthology and paralogy detection based on tree reconciliation or
          species overlap.
        - Relative dating of speciation and duplication events. 
        - Combined visualization of trees and MSA.
        - Integrated with the phylomeDB database

        GNU/Linux 
        ===========
        
        ETE requires python>=2.5 (python 3 is not supported) as well as several
        dependencies (required only to enable particular functions, but highly
        recommended):
        
        - python-qt4 (>=4.5) [Enables tree visualization and image rendering]
        - python-mysqldb (>=1.2) [Enables programmatic access to PhylomeDB]
        - python-numpy (Required to work with clustering trees)
        - python-lxml [Required to work whit NexML and PhyloXML phylogenetic formats]
        - python-setuptools [Optional. Allows to install and upgrade ETE]
        
        
        Meeting dependencies (Debian based distributions)
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        ETE is developed and tested under Debian based distributions
        (i.e. Ubuntu). All the above mentioned dependencies are in the
        official repositories of Debian and can be installed using a package
        manager such as APT, Synaptics or Adept. For instance, in Ubuntu you
        can use the following shell command to install all dependencies:
        
        :: 
        
          $ apt-get install python-setuptools python-numpy python-qt4 python-scipy python-mysqldb python-lxml
        
        
        Meeting dependencies (other GNU/Linux distributions)
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        In Non Debian based distributions, dependencies may not be necessarily
        found in their official repositories. If this occurs, libraries should
        be downloaded separately or installed from third part repositories. In
        general, this process should not entail important difficulties, except
        for PyQt4, which is a python binding to the new Qt4 libraries. Some
        distributions (i.e. CentOS, Fefora) do not include recent packages and
        cross-dependencies for such libraries yet. In such cases, manual
        compilation of libraries could be required.
        
         
        Installing or Upgrading ETE
        --------------------------------
        
        Easy Install is the best way to install ETE and keep it up to
        date. EasyInstall is a python module bundled with setuptools that lets
        you automatically download, build, install, and manage Python
        packages. If the easy_install command is available in your system, you
        can execute this shell command to install/update ETE.
        
        :: 
        
          $ easy_install -U ete2
        
        Alternatively, you can download the last version of ETE from
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ete2/, decompress the file and install the
        package by executing the setup installer:
        
        ::
        
          $ python setup.py install 
         
        MacOS
        =======
        
        ETE and all its dependencies are supported by MacOS Intel
        environments, however you will need to install some libraries from the
        external GNU/open-source repositories. This can be done easily by
        using MacPorts.
        
        The following recipe has been reported to work in MacOS 10.5.8 (thanks to Marco Mariotti and Alexis Grimaldi at the CRG):
        
          1. Install Mac Developer tools and X11 (required by Macports)
          2. Install Macports in your system: http://www.macports.org/install.php
          3. Install the following packages from the macports repository by using the "sudo port install [package_name]"  syntax (note that some packages may take a long time to be built and that you will need to have an active internet connection during the installation process):
             * python26
             * py26-numpy
             * py26-scipy
             * py26-pyqt4
             * py26-mysql
             * py26-lxml
          4. Download the setup installer of the last ETE version (http://ete.cgenomics.org/releases/ete2), uncompress it, enter its folder and run: "sudo python setup.py install" Once the installation has finished,  you will be able to load ETE (import ete2) when running the "right" python binary.
        
        .. note:: 
           
           If step 4 doesn't work, make sure that the python version your are
           using to install ETE is the one installed by MacPorts. This is
           usually located in
           ``/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/python2.6``.
           By contrast, non-Macport python version is the one located in
           ``/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/python2.6``,
           so check that you are using the correct python executable.
